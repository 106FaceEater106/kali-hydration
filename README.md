# kali-hydration
A basic bash script to configure Kali.
This script will pull in a number of git repos that I find useful, as well installing packages that I use regularly.

This is an on-going build and will be updated and tweaked as time goes on.

Feel free to use this as a base and tweak it to your own prefrences/liking.

If you're using Kali version earlier than 2020.4, then use the hydrate-2020-3.sh script, otherwise the hydrate-2020-4.sh script is what you want to use for 2020.4 onwards.
